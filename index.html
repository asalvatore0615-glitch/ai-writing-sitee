  <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
  <p>
    ChatGPT is an AI tool that helps users ask questions, generate ideas, explain complex topics,
    and assist with research and writing. Students frequently use it to explore concepts, improve
    drafts, and deepen understanding through natural conversation.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Findings</h2>
  <p>
    Research from 2024–2025 shows over half of college students rely on AI tools during
    academic writing. AI enhances clarity, organization, and understanding while speeding up
    the writing process.
  </p>

  <h2>How Students Can Use ChatGPT</h2>
  <p>
    Students can use the website or app to enter text, image, or audio prompts. ChatGPT Plus
    offers faster responses, image generation, longer conversations, and voice features.
  </p>

  <h2>Benefits</h2>
  <p>
    ChatGPT helps with all stages of writing: research, brainstorming, drafting, and editing. It can
    find sources, improve grammar, clarify sentences, and expand vocabulary—while keeping
    the student’s own voice intact.
  </p>

  <h2>AI in the Classroom</h2>
  <p>
    AI can act as a supplemental teaching tool. It helps students explore ideas, understand new
    perspectives, and prepare for future careers where AI collaboration is common.
  </p>

  <h2>Risks and Limitations</h2>
  <p>• AI may generate inaccurate information.</p>
  <p>• It can show bias based on training data.</p>
  <p>• Limited knowledge of new events can cause errors.</p>
  <p>• It can sound confident even when wrong.</p>
  <p>• Students can become overly dependent on it.</p>
  <p>• Privacy concerns exist because chats may be stored.</p>

  <h2>Ethical Use of AI</h2>
  <p>
    Students must use AI responsibly by avoiding plagiarism, citing AI when required, and keeping
    their own ideas present. AI is a tool—not the creator of the assignment.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Research shows that ChatGPT improves academic writing quality and efficiency. It benefits
    learners from different backgrounds and supports clearer expression of ideas from drafting to
    final editing.
